      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize" >i had visited in dec 2018</h5>
      <p class="text-muted" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize" >i had visited in nov 2017</h5>
      <p class="text-muted" >It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ‚Çπ15 for Indians but about ‚Çπ225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.

    <p>Every part was amazing, it didn‚Äôt feel dragged out or anything. Of course more time would‚Äôve been nice, but it was still fantastic. It was so cool to see Daredevil in it for a little bit. That scene where he fought doctor strange was just mind-blowing. I had a feeling Aunt May was gonna die, especially since she said that famous quote from Uncle Ben in Tobey and Andrew‚Äôs movies. Absolutely heartbreaking, but it builds on to the character development. I just knew that Tobey and Andrew would be in this movie, but a small part of me doubted it so that I wouldn‚Äôt get my hopes up. But when they came on to the screen, it felt so surreal and the audience went wild. It was so incredible to see all of our favorite Spider-Man on the screen together. I loved seeing them and their interactions. My favorite part was when MJ fell and Andrew‚Äôs Spider-Man caught herüò≠ like, it felt so heart-warming and it genuinely brought tears to my eyes because we all know he couldn‚Äôt save Gwen, but he just had to save Tom‚Äôs MJ. And you could see him getting all teary eyed and it just made that moment even more special.  Honestly that was one of the greatest scenes and I just keep replaying it in my head. I have never seen an audience go this wild  (even compared to Endgame/Infinity War) when Andrew swooped in to save her, there was so many applauds and ‚Äúawwws‚Äù all around. Truly magnificent. I absolutely loved it.
